# TeleCapture

This is a system which receives feedback from Telegram (third party API) and sends it to all relevant users (collaboration) along with showing previous messages (database).

## Bot Setup

We are using [Local Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#using-a-local-bot-api-server)

## Setting up the Webhook

We are using long-polling to dynamically receive updates.

## Steps to run the application locally

## Steps to run the application locally (using Docker)

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error in the console while establishing bot client

```
error: [polling_error] {"code":"EFATAL","message":"EFATAL: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.telegram.org"}
```

Try connecting to a different network.
